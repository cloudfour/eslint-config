Update typescript-eslint to v4

- [Require `@ts-expect-error` comments to have a description explaining why](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/2351)
- [New scope analyzer](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/2039). This is mostly bugfixes, but it is possible that it could cause rules to (correctly) trigger on code that they didn't before.
