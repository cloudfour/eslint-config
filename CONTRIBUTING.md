## Running @cloudfour/eslint-plugin on itself

In order to run `npm run lint` on this project, it needs to have a symlink to itself in `node_modules`, so that ESLint can find it. To set up this symlink, run `npm link` and then `npm link @cloudfour/eslint-plugin`. Then you should be able to run `npm run lint`.
